# Controlling Tello using M5 Stack UiFlow Blocks and MicroPython

This is a project wip to control DJI tello drone with M5Stack core.

TODO: 
1) reading asynchonously responses from drone with UDP webserver
2) reading parameters like battery level or speed...

IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!
Tello code block is embedded on UIFlow since 1.7.3 version.
So now is very easy to realize mission control for DJI Tello programming with simple block.
Read please DOC folder (ENG/IT) for examples of using it

Master Version and Italian docs written by Gian luigi Perrella. English translation of the docs written by Adam Bryant.

ENJOY IT and let me know your project!
